## Instructions

The game begins with the player placing bets using chip buttons in their bank. Once the bets are placed, two cards are drawn, with one of the dealers cards being shown facedown. The player can decide to hit or stay. By selcting hit, the player will receive an additional card, the goal being to keep the score of their overall hand under 21. Once they are satisfied with their hand, they can choose to stay. The dealer will draw additional cards until either their score reaches 17, or they bust (their score goes over 21).

## Additional Info

Given more time, I would have liked to implement some more advanced game rules in Blackjack, in order to recreate the traditional game as accurately as possible. This would include rules such as split hands and doubling down.
