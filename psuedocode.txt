//FLOW

//step 1
//define constants (values that dont change)
const deckCards = []
 
//looking up certain values


//step 2
//define state variables


//information we have to track while app is running
//declare variables but dont assign.
//write function to initialize variables


//step 3
//what elements have to be accessed
//more than once
//remember to cache (remember that variable)

//step 4
//add event listeners (DOM)
//use delgated event listeners
//event delagation (bubble up approach)


//step 5
//invoke init function all state variables
//lives outside of all code (global)
//may be call to the render function inside the init


//step 6
//invoke render function
//responisble for transferring all
//state variables to the DOM


//step 7//
//replay or reset
//recall init function


//step 8
//what state needs to be recalculated
//update all variables user clicked
//update state and then call render
